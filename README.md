# Overview
In a world that moves so quickly, there is often never time to reflect. And when we do...it's often on platforms that ask us to define ourselves through photos, who we're "friends" with, and people are worried about the "aesthetics" of their page...but on here, I'm asking you to forget about all of that. You won't know who follow's your writing, your thoughts, your truth, but if they feel inspired to connect with you, they can connect with you through email. Other than that, this is a platform for human beings to connect, build a community, and share posts about their truth, and hopefully along the way, we'll heal together ðŸ’›

# Installation Instructions

# As a user...

# Descriptions of any Unsolved Problems or Major Hurdles 
In the end, there were a lot of things that I wanted to implement but just didn't have enough time. In the future I plan to implement a page that shows all of the posts of all of the users.
